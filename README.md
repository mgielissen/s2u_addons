# s2u_addons
An alternative to the standard Odoo modules like: CRM, Accounting, Warehouse, Projects, Time sheets, Sales and Purchases, e-Commerce. Main focus is the Netherlands. The idea beyond this project is to have an answer for the critics we received from businesses/accountants about missing futures, missing/incomplete financial reports, difficult to work with, have to click on many buttons before something happens ... Customers who need a lot of customizations can benefit from this project. Our addons are able to work with many existing Odoo modules present in the community.

Currently Odoo 11 only.

To use it, create a new blanco Odoo database. Add the s2u_addons folder in your odoo conf.

Activate the developer mode in Odoo and "Update Apps List" in Apps, now search in the apps on "s2u".

Install the modules you want. If you have installed accounting, to get a default Chart of Accounts and VAT's etc, you go to Accounting -> Settings -> Templates. Select "default template" and click ok.

The main goal of s2u_addons is to do your accounting, project management, timesheets and subscriptions.
